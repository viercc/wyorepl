# Write Your Own REPL

This project is meant to be a tutorial to write your own REPL, using ["haskeline" package](https://www.stackage.org/lts-12.12/package/haskeline-0.7.4.3).

Each source file is written in literate Haskell, and intended to read them directly.
Recommented order of read is:

* [Language](src/Language.lhs)
* [Parser](src/Parser.lhs)
* [Main](src/Main.lhs)
* [ReplSyntax](src/ReplSyntax.lhs)
* [Repl](src/Repl.lhs)
* [Main](src/Main.lhs) again
